          "I had gone to Tadoba, a very popular national park in India. It was extremely hot – a great time to spot tigers. We were near a water body, anticipating a tiger coming in any time. After waiting in the sun for about 3 hours, two gorgeous tigers entered the pond to drink water at the same time. I got a beautiful shot – I was super happy! The whole experience was super serene and made me forget all the hard work I had to do to get that shot. But that joy lasted for about 30 seconds. When I zoomed into the shot, just about an inch away from the tiger's mouth, there was a plastic bottle. That was shocking! It showed us a bigger problem we're all facing on this planet. So much plastic pollution happening even in remote areas! That, to me, was the trigger… there was no looking back. I had to do something."
